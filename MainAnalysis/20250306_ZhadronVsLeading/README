to run the "workflow" for this analysis follow these steps. Assume you are working in the "workflow" directory.

1. Build the executable:
   ```
   make -C ..
   ```

2. Make the directiories for the output and plots:
    ```
    mkdir -p output
    mkdir -p plots
    ```

3. Make soft links to the input files, residual correction files, and executable:
    ```
    ln -s /data/yjlee/PhysicsZHadronEEC/MainAnalysis/20241102_ZhadronVsZPt/workflow/mergedSample mergedSample
    ln -s /data/yjlee/PhysicsZHadronEEC/MainAnalysis/20241102_ZhadronVsZPt/workflow/residualCorrection2023 residualCorrection2023
    ln -s ../ExecuteCorrelationAnalysis ExecuteCorrelationAnalysis
    ```

4. Run the desired analysis code. For example, the pp analysis:
    ```
    ./pp-analysis.sh
    ```
  
The main analysis script is `LeadingTrkAnalysis.cpp`, edits made to this should always be met with running `make` so that `ExecuteCorrelationAnalysis` is updated. The various .sh scripts in the workflow directory handle different types of analysis with different input files. Most of these .sh scripts call `finalAnalysis.sh`, which in turn calls the executable and handles paralelizing the code on multiple cpus - the thread count can be changed in that file, as well as calls to plotting scripts.
